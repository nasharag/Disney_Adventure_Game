    "I have no coding experience prior to this Python class. In fact, I was someone you could consider who was quite illiterate when it came to any form of technology. My coding project went above and beyond because I was able to learn and impliment coding style, conditionals, and the use of functions that affect the adventure game. This was a challenge as I have never coded in my life and I went out of my comfort zone to produce this well functioning game."
